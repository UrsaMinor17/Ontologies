	 \subsection{Compentency Questions}
	 Our final ontology will be able to answer the following questions. 
	 
	 	\begin{enumerate}
	 		\item Which folk tales fall into a given motif class, e.g. ATU 70-99 Other Wild Animals? 
	 		\item Which Dramatis Personae appear in a given tale? 
	 		\item Which region do folk tales come from that fall into given motif classes? 
	 		\item Which Proppian functions appear in African folk tales? 
	 		\item How are Dramatis Personae interacting in the African folk tales, e.g. which figures use the "interdiction" relation?
	 		\item Is there a dominating interaction between certain classes of Dramatis Personae, e.g. the villain causes harm to the hero's parents?
	 		\item Which sequences of Proppian functions appear in the given tale?
	 		\item Which Proppian functions follow a given function predominantely, i.e. are there patterns withing the Proppian sequences? 
	 		\item Who is the editor of an anthology with folk tales from a given origin?
	 		\item How are Proppian functions verbalised, i.e. which words are used to describe events that fall into a given function class? 
	 	\end{enumerate}
